-Type of variables:
Explanatory variables : Variables which define the response variable
X1, X2, X3, X4...
Response variable : The one whose content we are trying to model using explanatory variables. Ther is only one response variable in one model
Y

-Type of model depending upon type of variable:
    ~Explanatory variables :
        all continous: Regression
        all categorial: Analysis of varianc (Anova)
        mixed variables: Analysis of covariance (Ancova)
    ~Response variable (depending on kind of data) :
        continous: Normal Regression, Anova, Ancova
        proportion: Logistic Regression
        count: Log linear models
        binary: Binary logistic analysis
        time-at-death: Survival analysis
