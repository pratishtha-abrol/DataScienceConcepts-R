# DataScienceConcepts-R

  This repo deals with the R code for different methods of Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
  Includes source code as well as information on associated libraries to manipulate and analyse data.

I suggest installing R studio to run the code.
Install packages with the command install.packages('package_name')

Kindly notify errors, if found.
